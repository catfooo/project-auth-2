# i made a new repo
the reason im doing this is i am stuck.
or, at least, im feeling like stuck.
just done giving negative feedback for career coaching program,
saying that i dont have any time and energy with that program.
i stated how much negative situation that im having and had currently,
and that made me miserable.
so, i wasnt feeling for deal with the previous error that mern repo has. 
but given the reason to go through that was i had hard time with this w16s project,
project-auth,
not even getting to think i could do the project,
at the very moment i started this,
so i just wanted to go back to here,
and recheck what i needed to do. 

## where i stopped?
i remember i stopped this while dealing with frontend.
i was making input field to send to backend.
might work for authentication process, if i worked further at that place.
but i did not proceed,
because i wanted to know , i wanted to make sure
that i was sending data to server side.
i was not recognizing backend server clearly. 
like, things happening in local server, and actual database.
while look back into w14s project,
i found out that i wasnt connecting to mongodb database at all.
the console message from the video at w14s notion page,
was leading me to create console log for 'mongoDB connected',
but i was not really sure that i was connected actually at that time,
and this turned out that i was actually not connected.
it was just msg saying it is connected,
but i couldnt make this sure.
so this took long way with mern tutorial. 
while watching that video, i found out ive learned this in wrong way,
from very long time ago(at the moment of w14) ,
and i needed to fix my knowledge by following that video. 

now, i know how to connect the database.
i even see the data i send to the database.
so it cant be more sure than this.

so, lets go back to the place i stopped while i work for w16s project.
did i connected to the database? i dont think so.
was i sending the info to the backend side? like, was i communicating properly? i doubt.

# how i will proceed?
there can be several ways. 
what i want to do is submit this project again.
first, in order to submit, i need to fork.
ive already forked, and i dont think i want to continue working at previous repo.
will there be any way to restart compelety new, and then, submit?
i think ive asked question about this at stack. 
so ill check this again and start with this, with new start.
