# i made a new repo
the reason im doing this is i am stuck.
or, at least, im feeling like stuck.
just done giving negative feedback for career coaching program,
saying that i dont have any time and energy with that program.
i stated how much negative situation that im having and had currently,
and that made me miserable.
so, i wasnt feeling for deal with the previous error that mern repo has. 
but given the reason to go through that was i had hard time with this w16s project,
project-auth,
not even getting to think i could do the project,
at the very moment i started this,
so i just wanted to go back to here,
and recheck what i needed to do. 

## where i stopped?
i remember i stopped this while dealing with frontend.
i was making input field to send to backend.
might work for authentication process, if i worked further at that place.
but i did not proceed,
because i wanted to know , i wanted to make sure
that i was sending data to server side.
i was not recognizing backend server clearly. 
like, things happening in local server, and actual database.
while look back into w14s project,
i found out that i wasnt connecting to mongodb database at all.
the console message from the video at w14s notion page,
was leading me to create console log for 'mongoDB connected',
but i was not really sure that i was connected actually at that time,
and this turned out that i was actually not connected.
it was just msg saying it is connected,
but i couldnt make this sure.
so this took long way with mern tutorial. 
while watching that video, i found out ive learned this in wrong way,
from very long time ago(at the moment of w14) ,
and i needed to fix my knowledge by following that video. 

now, i know how to connect the database.
i even see the data i send to the database.
so it cant be more sure than this.

so, lets go back to the place i stopped while i work for w16s project.
did i connected to the database? i dont think so.
was i sending the info to the backend side? like, was i communicating properly? i doubt.

# how i will proceed?
there can be several ways. 
what i want to do is submit this project again.
first, in order to submit, i need to fork.
ive already forked, and i dont think i want to continue working at previous repo.
will there be any way to restart compelety new, and then, submit?
i think ive asked question about this at stack. 
so ill check this again and start with this, with new start.

If you want to start all from scratch, you can delete the repo from your Github account, and delete the code files from your computer and then do a new fork from the Technigo repo.

and yes, this means that i need to give up the previous project auth, and then, restart.
and i dont want to do that, bcs i want to save where i were. 
so i can go back and check whenever i want.


so... if this is what i got for the answer, ill look into that previous project auth repo,
and clone that time to time with another repo,
so i can see the status, where i were, before. 

but idk really. is the thing supposed to be this much annoying?
imagine you are making text file with wordprocess or something.
we can just easily go back, edit, and so on.
why things have been this much difficult for me for git?
it doesnt make sense. i think bcs i dont know git well, i suffer this much.
but what i need to learn, and how i can learn?
idk my current status and need someone to tell me what to do.
spamming repo for every moment that i feel to save is ridiculous
